### The `vue` Command (The Global `@vue/cli` Package)

### `@vue/cli-service`

Updated several underlying loaders and plugins:

* Updated `copy-webpack-plugin` from v5 to v6. If you never customized its config through `config.plugin('copy')`, there should be no user-facing breaking changes. A full list of breaking changes is available at <https://github.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin/releases/tag/v6.0.0>.
* Updated `file-loader` from v4 to v6, and `url-loader` from v2 to v4. The `esModule` option is now turned on by default for non-Vue-2 projects.
