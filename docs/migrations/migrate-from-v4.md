## Breaking Changes

### For All Packages

* Drop support of Node.js 8, 11, 13

### The Global `@vue/cli` and The `vue` Command

### `@vue/cli-plugin-eslint`

* `eslint-loader` is upgraded [from v2 to v4](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/eslint-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). The only major change is that it dropped support for ESLint < v6.

### `@vue/cli-plugin-typescript`

#### Dropped TSLint support

As [TSLint has been deprecated](https://github.com/palantir/tslint/issues/4534), we [removed](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/5065) all TSLint-related code in this version.
Please consider switching to ESLint. You can check out [`tslint-to-eslint-config`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/tslint-to-eslint-config) for a mostly automatic migration experience.

### `@vue/cli-plugin-unit-mocha`

* Updated `mocha` from v6 to v7, please refer to the release notes of [mocha v7](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/releases/tag/v7.0.0) for a complete list of breaking changes.
