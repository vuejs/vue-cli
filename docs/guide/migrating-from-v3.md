# Migrating from v3

First, install the latest Vue CLI globally:
```
npm install -g @vue/cli@4
```

## Auto Migration

In your existing projects, run:
```
vue upgrade --next
```

Please refer to the [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) section for all the possible breaking changes introduced.

------

## Manual Migration

If you want to do the migration manually and gradually, here are the tips:

### The Global `@vue/cli` Package

The `vue upgrade` command was [redesigned](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/4090).
- Before: `vue upgrade [patch | minor | major]`, and it does nothing more than install the latest versions of Vue CLI plugins.
- After: `vue upgrade [plugin-name]`. Aside from upgrading the plugins, it can run migrators from plugins to help you automate the migration process. For more options for this command, please run `vue upgrade --help`.

---

When running `vue invoke` / `vue add` / `vue upgrade`, there's now an [extra confirmation step](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/4275) if you have uncommitted changes in the current repository.

---

When running `vue add vuex` or `vue add router`:
- in v3, only `vuex` or `vue-router` will be added to the project;
- in v4, there will also be `@vue/cli-plugin-vuex` & `@vue/cli-plugin-router` installed.

This currently does not make an actual difference for end users, but such design allows us to add more features for vuex & vue-router users later.

### `@vue/cli-service`

* [#4323](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/4323) ensure consistent directory structure for all modes

* [#4302](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/4302) move dev configs into serve command

* [TODO: notes on less-loader version]


#### `vue.config.js`

* The already-deprecated [`baseUrl` option](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#baseurl) is now [removed](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/4388)

* [deprecate `css.modules` in favor of `css.requireModuleExtension`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/4387). This is because we've upgraded to css-loader v3 and the config format has been changed. For more detailed explanation please follow the link.

* [Upgraded versions of several underlying webpack loaders](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/4331) [TODO elaborate this]

If you've customized the internal rules with `chainWebpack`, please notice that `webpack-chain` was updated from v4 to v6, the most noticeable change is the `minimizer` config. [TODO: add example here].

Please also notice that the following rules/loaders have been updated:

1. [`copy-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#500-2019-02-20), the `debug` option was renamed to `logLevel`
2. [use EnvironmentPlugin instead of DefinePlugin for `process.env.*` vars](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/3782), [TODO: detailed explanation]
3. [The `pug-plain` rule was renamed to `pug-plain-loader`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/4230)

### `@vue/babel-preset-app`, `@vue/cli-plugin-babel`

- [Upgrade to core-js v3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/3912). [TODO: detailed explanation]
- Use `@vue/cli-plugin-babel/preset` [TODO: auto migration & elaborate on this]

------

### `@vue/cli-plugin-eslint`

This plugin now [requires ESLint as a peer dependency]((https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/3852)).

This won't affect projects scaffolded with Vue CLI 3.1 or later.

If your project was scaffolded with Vue CLI 3.0.x or earlier, you may need to add `eslint@4` to your project dependencies (This is automated if you upgrade the plugin using `vue upgrade eslint --next`).

It's also recommended to upgrade your ESLint to v5, and ESLint config versions to latest. (ESLint v6 support is still on the way)

---

[TODO][Notes on prettier config]

---

(the following only affects development)

The default value of `lintOnSave` option (when not specified) was [changed from `true` to `'default'`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/3975). You can read more on the detailed explanation in the [documentation](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#lintonsave).

In a nutshell:
- In v3, by default, lint warnings, along with errors, will be displayed in the error overlay
- In v4, by default, only lint errors will interrupt your development process. Warnings are only logged in the terminal console.

### `@vue/cli-plugin-pwa`

* [Upgraded to workbox v4](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/3915)
* [`manifest.json` is now generated by the plugin itself](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/2981)

### `@vue/cli-plugin-e2e-cypress`

Before Vue CLI v3.0.0-beta.10, the default command for E2E testing was `vue-cli-service e2e`. Later we changed it to `vue-cli-service test:e2e`. The previous command was since deprecated but still supported.
We have now completely [dropped support for this legacy command](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/3774).

### `@vue/cli-plugin-e2e-nightwatch`

* [#3388](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/3388) upgrade to nightwatch v1
* [#3916](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/3916) upgrade to chromedriver v74 and make it a peer dependency
* [#3774](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/3774) remove support for legacy `vue-cli-service e2e` command

### `@vue/cli-plugin-typescript`

When using Typescript, the webpack resolve options now [prefer `ts(x)` file extensions over `js(x)` ones](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/3909).

### `@vue/cli-plugin-unit-jest`

* [Upgraded to jest v24](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/3870)

[TODO: More detailed information to be addedâ€¦]

### `@vue/cli-plugin-unit-mocha`

* Use mochapack instead of mocha-webpack, see changelog at <https://github.com/sysgears/mochapack/releases>. This change is not likely to affect actual usage.
* Upgraded to mocha 6, see <https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#600-0--2019-01-01>

### `@vue/cli-service-global`

See breaking changes in the [`@vue/cli-service`](#vue-cli-service) & [`@vue/cli-plugin-eslint`](#vue-cli-plugin-eslint) packages.
