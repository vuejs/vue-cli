# Build Targets

When you run `vue-cli-service build`, you can specify different build targets via the `--target` option. This allows you to use the same code base to produce different builds for different use cases.

## App

App is the default build target. In this mode:

- `index.html` with asset and resource hints injection
- vendor libraries split into a separate chunk for better caching
- static assets under 4kb are inlined into JavaScript
- static assets in `public` are copied into output directory

## Library

::: tip Note on Vue Dependency
In lib mode, Vue is *externalized*. This means the bundle will not bundle Vue even if your code imports Vue. If the lib is used via a bundler, it will attempt to load Vue as a dependency through the bundler; otherwise, it falls back to a global `Vue` variable.

To avoid this behavior provide `--inline-vue` flag to `build` command.

```
vue-cli-service build --target lib --inline-vue
```
:::

You can build a single entry as a library using

```
vue-cli-service build --target lib --name myLib [entry]
```

```
File                     Size                     Gzipped

dist/myLib.umd.min.js    13.28 kb                 8.42 kb
dist/myLib.umd.js        20.95 kb                 10.22 kb
dist/myLib.common.js     20.57 kb                 10.09 kb
dist/myLib.css           0.33 kb                  0.23 kb
```

The entry can be either a `.js` or a `.vue` file. If no entry is specified, `src/App.vue` will be used.

A lib build outputs:

- `dist/myLib.common.js`: A CommonJS bundle for consuming via bundlers (unfortunately, webpack currently does not support ES modules output format for bundles yet)

- `dist/myLib.umd.js`: A UMD bundle for consuming directly in browsers or with AMD loaders

- `dist/myLib.umd.min.js`: Minified version of the UMD build.

- `dist/myLib.css`: Extracted CSS file (can be forced into inlined by setting `css: { extract: false }` in `vue.config.js`)

### Vue vs. JS/TS Entry Files

When using a `.vue` file as entry, your library will directly expose the Vue component itself, because the component is always the default export.

However, when you are using a `.js` or `.ts` file as your entry, it may contain named exports, so your library will be exposed as a Module. This means the default export of your library must be accessed as `window.yourLib.default` in UMD builds, or as `const myLib = require('mylib').default` in CommonJS builds. If you don't have any named exports and wish to directly expose the default export, you can use the following webpack configuration in `vue.config.js`:

``` js
module.exports = {
  configureWebpack: {
    output: {
      libraryExport: 'default'
    }
  }
}
```

## Web Component

::: tip Note on Compatibility
Web Component mode does not support IE11 and below. [More details](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-web-component-wrapper#compatibility)

::: tip Note on Vue Dependency
In web component mode, Vue is *externalized.* This means the bundle will not bundle Vue even if your code imports Vue. The bundle will assume `Vue` is available on the host page as a global variable.

To avoid this behavior provide `--inline-vue` flag to `build` command.

```
vue-cli-service build --target wc --inline-vue
```
:::

You can build a single entry as a web component using

```
vue-cli-service build --target wc --name my-element [entry]
```

Note that the entry should be a `*.vue` file. Vue CLI will automatically wrap and register the component as a Web Component for you, and there's no need to do this yourself in `main.js`. You can use `main.js` as a demo app solely for development.

The build will produce a single JavaScript file (and its minified version) with everything inlined. The script, when included on a page, registers the `<my-element>` custom element, which wraps the target Vue component using `@vue/web-component-wrapper`. The wrapper automatically proxies properties, attributes, events and slots. See the [docs for `@vue/web-component-wrapper`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-web-component-wrapper) for more details.

**Note the bundle relies on `Vue` being globally available on the page.**

This mode allows consumers of your component to use the Vue component as a normal DOM element:

``` html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>
<script src="path/to/my-element.js"></script>

<!-- use in plain HTML, or in any other framework -->
<my-element></my-element>
```

### Bundle that Registers Multiple Web Components

When building a web component bundle, you can also target multiple components by using a glob as entry:

```
vue-cli-service build --target wc --name foo 'src/components/*.vue'
```

When building multiple web components, `--name` will be used as the prefix and the custom element name will be inferred from the component filename. For example, with `--name foo` and a component named `HelloWorld.vue`, the resulting custom element will be registered as `<foo-hello-world>`.

### Async Web Component

When targeting multiple web components, the bundle may become quite large, and the user may only use a few of the components your bundle registers. The async web component mode produces a code-split bundle with a small entry file that provides the shared runtime between all the components, and registers all the custom elements upfront. The actual implementation of a component is then fetched on-demand only when an instance of the corresponding custom element is used on the page:

```
vue-cli-service build --target wc-async --name foo 'src/components/*.vue'
```

```
File                Size                        Gzipped

dist/foo.0.min.js    12.80 kb                    8.09 kb
dist/foo.min.js      7.45 kb                     3.17 kb
dist/foo.1.min.js    2.91 kb                     1.02 kb

dist/foo.1.js        5.24 kb                     1.64 kb
```

Now on the page, the user only needs to include Vue and the entry file:

``` html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>
<script src="path/to/foo.min.js"></script>

<!-- foo-one's implementation chunk is auto fetched when it's used -->
<foo-one></foo-one>
```
