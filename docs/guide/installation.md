# Installation

::: warning Warning regarding Previous Versions
The package name changed from `vue-cli` to `@vue/cli`.
If you have the previous `vue-cli` (1.x or 2.x) package installed globally, you need to uninstall it first with `npm uninstall vue-cli -g` or `yarn global remove vue-cli`.
:::

::: tip Node Version Requirement
Vue CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 8.9 or above (8.11.0+ recommended). You can manage multiple versions of Node on the same machine with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).
:::

To install the new package, use one of those commands:

``` bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
# OR
yarn global add @vue/cli
```

After installation, you will have access to the `vue` binary in your command line. You can verify that it is properly installed by simply running `vue`, which should present you with a help message listing all available commands.

You can check you have the right version (3.x) with this command:

```bash
vue --version
```
