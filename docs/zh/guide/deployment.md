# Deployment

## General Guidelines

If you are using Vue CLI along with a backend framework that handles static assets as part of its deployment, all you need to do is making sure Vue CLI generates the built files in the correct location, and then follow the deployment instruction of your backend framework.

If you are developing your frontend app separately from your backend - i.e. your backend exposes an API for your frontend to talk to, then your frontend is essentially a purely static app. You can deploy the built content in the `dist` directory to any static file server, but make sure to set the correct [baseUrl](../config/#baseurl).

### Previewing Locally

The `dist` directory is meant to be served by an HTTP server, so it will not work if you open `dist/index.html` directly over `file://` protocol. The easiest way to preview your production build locally is using a Node.js static file server, for example [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve):

``` bash
npm install -g serve
# -s flag means serve it in Single-Page Application mode
# which deals with the routing problem below
serve -s dist
```

### Routing with `history.pushState`

If you are using Vue Router in `history` mode, a simple static file server will fail. For example, if you used Vue Router with a route for `/todos/42`, the dev server has been configured to respond to `localhost:3000/todos/42` properly, but a simple static server serving a production build will respond with a 404 instead.

To fix that, you will need to configure your production server to fallback to `index.html` for any requests that do not match a static file. The Vue Router docs provides [configuration instructions for common server setups](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html).

### CORS

If your static frontend is deployed to a different domain from your backend API, you will need to properly configure [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

### PWA

If you are using the PWA plugin, your app must be served over HTTPS so that [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) can be properly registered.

## Platform Guides

### GitLab Pages

As described by [GitLab Pages documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/), everything happens with a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file placed in the root of your repository. This working example will get you started:

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml file to be placed in the root of your repository

pages: # the job must be named pages
  image: node:latest
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm run build
    - mv public public-vue # GitLab Pages hooks on the public folder
    - mv dist public # rename the dist folder (result of npm run build)
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public # artifact path must be /public for GitLab Pages to pick it up
  only:
    - master
```

Typically, your static website will be hosted on https://yourUserName.gitlab.io/yourProjectName, so you will also want to create an initial `vue.config.js` file to [update the `BASE_URL`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/tree/dev/docs/config#baseurl) value to match:

```javascript
// vue.config.js file to be place in the root of your repository
// make sure you update `yourProjectName` with the name of your GitLab project

module.exports = {
  baseUrl: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? '/yourProjectName/'
    : '/'
}
```

Please read through the docs on [GitLab Pages domains](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/getting_started_part_one.html#gitlab-pages-domain) for more info about the URL where your project website will be hosted. Be aware you can also [use a custom domain](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/getting_started_part_three.html#adding-your-custom-domain-to-gitlab-pages).

Commit both the `.gitlab-ci.yml` and `vue.config.js` files before pushing to your repository. A GitLab CI pipeline will be triggered: when successful, visit your project's `Settings > Pages` to see your website link, and click on it.
