### Zero-config Prototyping

You can rapidly prototype with just a single `*.vue` file with the `vue serve` and `vue build` commands, but they require an additional global addon to be installed:

``` sh
yarn global add @vue/cli-service-global
echo '<template><h1>Hello!</h1></template>' > App.vue
vue serve
```

`vue serve` uses the same default setup (webpack, babel, postcss & eslint) as projects created by `vue create`. It automatically infers the entry file in the current directory - the entry can be one of `main.js`, `index.js`, `App.vue` or `app.vue`. If needed, you can also provide an `index.html`, install and use local dependencies, or even configure babel, postcss & eslint with corresponding config files.

The drawback of `vue serve` is that it relies on globally installed dependencies which may be inconsistent on different machines. Therefore this is only recommended for rapid prototyping.

### Installing Plugins in an Existing Project

Each CLI plugin ships with a generator (which creates files) and a runtime plugin (which tweaks the core webpack config and injects commands). When you use `vue create` to create a new project, some plugins will be pre-installed for you based on your feature selection. In case you want to install a plugin into an already created project, simply install it first:

``` sh
yarn add @vue/cli-plugin-eslint
```

Then you can invoke the plugin's generator so it generates files into your project:

``` sh
# the @vue/cli-plugin- prefix can be omitted
vue invoke eslint
```

In addition, you can pass options to the plugin:

``` sh
vue invoke eslint --config airbnb --lintOn save
```

It is recommended to commit your project's current state before running `vue invoke`, so that after file generation you can review the changes and revert if needed.

### Pulling `vue-cli@2.x` Templates (Legacy)

`@vue/cli` uses the same `vue` binary, so it overwrites `vue-cli@2.x`. If you still need the legacy `vue init` functionality, you can install a global bridge:

``` sh
yarn global add @vue/cli-init
# vue init now works exactly the same as vue-cli@2.x
vue init webpack my-project
```

### Customizing Webpack Config

Create a `vue.config.js` in project root: (**Note:** if you have a `vue` field in your `package.json`, you need to move that here as well)

``` js
// vue.config.js
module.exports = {
  chainWebpack: chainableConfig => {
     // modify config with webpack-chain
     // https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/webpack-chain
  },

  configureWebpack: config => {
    // mutate config directly, or return new config
  },

  // object literal will be merged into base config using webpack-merge
  configureWebpack: {
    // ...
  }
}
```
