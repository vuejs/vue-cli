// A dev-only middleware that resets service workers for the current host:port
// This is for dealing with cases where a developer loads the dev and prod
// versions of an app on the same host:port combination, causing the prod
// service worker to hijack subsequent visits in dev mode.

// Note this doesn't always immediately fix the problem - if the server used
// to serve the production app has a long cache header for /service-worker.js,
// this noop service worker will not be able to take effect. In such cases,
// the developer will have to manually unregister the service worker in
// Chrome Devtools -> Application -> Service Workers
